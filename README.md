# Plato Pizza Analysis
**INTRODUCTION**


As a BI analyst, I carried out an analysis on Plato’s pizza sales data for the year 2015 to enable the organization gain insight and make better driven decision for next year sales. I was provided with a dataset by the company which was needed to be cleaned. I used python to clean, manipulate and derived some insightful analysis for Plato’s pizza to prepare them ahead of next year.
