# Plato Pizza Analysis
**INTRODUCTION**
As a BI analyst, I carried out an analysis on Plato’s pizza sales data for the year 2015 to enable the organization gain insight and make better driven decision for next year sales. I was provided with a dataset by the company which was needed to be cleaned. After cleaning the data, I transformed, model the data and derived some insightful analysis for Plato’s pizza to prepare them ahead of next year.Python was used for the cleaning and visuals of the analysis.
